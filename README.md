### In Summary
The analysis is shown over a 2 hour timeframe for using the bikes.  The visualization shows the service is mostly used by men.  Highest usage time is commuting hours(to and from work).  Saw an increase in usage on the weekends.
Recommend doing further analysis on popular areas the bikes are used in. Also, figure out a way to have more females use the service.

This challenge had its obstacles.  I made it harder than it needed to be.  I lost all my data doing a git commit.  Had to restore the previous commit.  Lost files in git hub.  Files replace with Jupyter Notebook file.  Had to add ReadMe again.  This was a great exercise.
